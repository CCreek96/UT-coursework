			<h3> OPINION </h3>
			<p>
			Things are stuff, but not all stuff are things. This may seem confusing at first if you think too much abotu it. I try not to think to much about it because then it makes it difficult to write articles to fill space on a page. Do you like to write? Writing can actually be used as a way to relieve stress for some people. Others write because they need a lot of words to take of a portion of space on a webpage. It will be worth it though, because once it is finished with it will look pretty darn cool.

				<h3> BREAKING: Sometimes It Be Like It Do </h3>
				<p>
					Are You aware that sometimes it be like it do? Many of us will go there entire lives without truly realizing that it be that way. A new study published by The Institute of Stuff and Things finds that nearly 60 percent of the time it really do be that way 100 percent of the time.
				</p>
				
				<h3> POLITICS: The World Is On Fire And It's Their Fault </h3>
				<p>
					Everyone knows who the other side is, it is obvious. It is also obvious that they are bad. They do things we don't like and thats bad. Sure we do things that they don't like, but is that our fault? No! it is their fault. With that being said, give us your money and maybe we might think about doing something good for people. 
				</p>
				
				<h3>BUSINESS: Things Are Pretty Chill Over Here Besides The Tariffs</h3>
				<p>
					Top international business person told The Daily Clarion that the global economic outlook is strong, or atleast would be if, "the U.S. and U.K. could get their *expletive* together," in terms of international trade and foreign policy.
